  <h1 class="post-title">Building a Latex resume and not worrying about compiling it</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Feb 03, 2018</span>
  <p>A long time ago I came accross Adrian Friggeri&rsquo;s resume built with Latex. I couldn&rsquo;t find the original template, but did found <a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv">this page</a> with a customization.</p>

<p>I found that template amazing and I decided I wanted my resume to be like that. I was looking for a new job, so why not?  That being said, I spent hours and hours on it; I installed uncountable dependencies, made some Helvetica fonts work on my Linux box, created the perfect descriptions for my previous positions, adjusted the alignments with so much care. Phew, I finally managed to have my fancy curriculum!</p>

<p>Eventually I got a new job and forgot about it, until I decided to update it. At that point I had a clean OS installation, so I&rsquo;d have to install all those dependencies again. As a result, I decided to ditch that resume and build a simpler one, based on the well-known <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv">moderncv</a> template. This one was simpler to compile as it required fewer dependencies so I thought my problem was soved.</p>

<p>However, recently I decided to update it, and guess what? For some reason it didn&rsquo;t compile. Then I realized that the building process of my resume would be a great candidate to be containerized. To make things better, I found out that there is a <code>moderncv</code> package available in Fedora 27. So I quickly put together this simple Dockerfile in my resume directory:</p>

<pre><code>FROM fedora-minimal:27

VOLUME /data

WORKDIR /data

RUN microdnf update &amp;&amp; \
    microdnf install texlive texlive-xetex texlive-moderncv &amp;&amp; \
    microdnf clean all
</code></pre>

<p>Voilà! Build the image, push it to Docker Hub and you will never have install <code>texlive</code> and its dependencies only to compile your resume again.</p>

<p>If you are interested you can check my <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/resume">GitHub repository</a> for a complete example.</p>
