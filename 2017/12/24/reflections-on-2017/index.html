  <h1 class="post-title">Reflections on 2017</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Dec 24, 2017</span>
  

<h1 id="on-reading">On reading</h1>

<p>I managed to complete my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/5493-2017-reading-challenge">2017 Reading Challenge</a> and read 12 books this year. This was an improvement from last year, when I read only 5.</p>

<p>To be quite frankly, I strategically picked a few small books so I could finish the challenge on time. I believe this is OK, but I would rather measure my reading habit by days I actually read something. Since it would be more difficult to track this approach, I am OK with the number of books for now.</p>

<p>Also, 2017 was the year that I got interested in fiction books. Non-fiction books are great to get new insights, but there is nothing more enjoyable that reading a good story in the early morning over a cup of coffee.</p>

<h1 id="on-writing-software">On writing software</h1>

<p>On the software engineeting side, I broke some new grounds in 2017.</p>

<p>I learned a little bit of Rust in the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>I read the first edition of The Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition">Programming Language</a> book and after a few days I manged to overcome the borrow checker and compile some small programs. Following that, I implemented a simple Pomodor timer that I called <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/prod">prod</a>. The highlight of the journey, though, was my implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/coreutils/commit/0a06679980e8b03d734a3ee5e3f5c2a785b081b6">uniq</a> command for the Redox OS.</p>

<p>I also got a bit more experience in Go. I developed a prototype for an NTP server called <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/ohrad">ohrad</a>. Also, I implemented a simple HTTTP daemon in my job. The highlight was <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah/pull/336">buildah PR</a>. This one was very rewarding for me, specially because buildah is part of the <a href="https://www.projectatomic.io/">Atomic Project</a>.</p>

<p>The ugly duckling was C. In the hope to get more experience in this language I started a simple in-memory cache that I called <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/hashd">hashd</a>. I never really finished it, but I did learned a few new things on the way.</p>

<h1 id="on-changing-jobs">On changing jobs</h1>

<p>2017 was the year that I left Scrapinghub and joined Red Hat.</p>

<p>I left Scrapinghub after 3 years I can&rsquo;t even describe how much I evolved there. I was very happy to be joining Red Hat, but at the same time I was very sad to leave Scrapinghub.</p>

<p>The process of getting my Czech Visa approved took around 6 months, but fortunatelly everything worked out well.</p>

<h1 id="on-writing">On writing</h1>

<p>In 2017 I wrote many journal entries, but I failed to make it a habit. I found it a tedius task, but I confedd it&rsquo;s pretty rewarding to read something I wrote a long time ago. It&rsquo;s impressive to see how much I evolved and, at the same time, how I struggle with some recurring issues.</p>

<p>When it comes to blogging, I completely failed in 2017. I put down some random notes from different topics that later would become blog posts, but they never really reached to their  final destination.</p>

<h1 id="on-playing-the-guitar">On playing the guitar</h1>

<p>I started to play the guitar but I had to leave it in Brazil. I made some progress and managed to play a few simple musics and fingerstyles. Nothing that someone would enjoy listening to, though.</p>

<h1 id="on-lifting">On lifting</h1>

<p>I was deadlifting 140 kilos and squatting 136 kilos (not counting the bar) right before moving to Czech Republic. I had to stop lifting for a while until I settled down in Czech Republic, and my weights went down considerably. Hopefully I will get back to those numbers in 2018!</p>

<h1 id="on-traveling">On traveling</h1>

<p>The only long travel of 2017 happened when I moved from Brazil to Czech Republic. However, living in the middle of Europe brings great advantages! In 2017 I managed to visit 4 countries for the first time: Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Hungary.</p>
