        <span class="post-date">Feb 03, 2018</span>
        <p>A long time ago I came accross Adrian Friggeri&rsquo;s resume built with Latex. I couldn&rsquo;t find the original template, but did found <a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv">this page</a> with a customization.</p>

<p>I found that template amazing and I decided I wanted my resume to be like that. I was looking for a new job, so why not?  That being said, I spent hours and hours on it; I installed uncountable dependencies, made some Helvetica fonts work on my Linux box, created the perfect descriptions for my previous positions, adjusted the alignments with so much care. Phew, I finally managed to have my fancy curriculum!</p>

<p>Eventually I got a new job and forgot about it, until I decided to update it. At that point I had a clean OS installation, so I&rsquo;d have to install all those dependencies again. As a result, I decided to ditch that resume and build a simpler one, based on the well-known <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv">moderncv</a> template. This one was simpler to compile as it required fewer dependencies so I thought my problem was soved.</p>

<p>However, recently I decided to update it, and guess what? For some reason it didn&rsquo;t compile. Then I realized that the building process of my resume would be a great candidate to be containerized. To make things better, I found out that there is a <code>moderncv</code> package available in Fedora 27. So I quickly put together this simple Dockerfile in my resume directory:</p>

<pre><code>FROM fedora-minimal:27

VOLUME /data

WORKDIR /data

RUN microdnf update &amp;&amp; \
    microdnf install texlive texlive-xetex texlive-moderncv &amp;&amp; \
    microdnf clean all
</code></pre>

<p>Voilà! Build the image, push it to Docker Hub and you will never have install <code>texlive</code> and its dependencies only to compile your resume again.</p>

<p>If you are interested you can check my <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/resume">GitHub repository</a> for a complete example.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Dec 27, 2017</span>
        

<p>Recently, I have been looking into how to implement Linux Namespaces in Go.</p>

<p>In C, the way we isolate a process in certain Namespaces is by specifying them in the <code>tags</code> parameter of <code>clone(2)</code>. For instance, <code>user_namespaces(7)</code> provides the following example to illustrate this.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">(...)

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Everything looks well and good, so I wanted to do the same in Go. However, I soon found out that <code>fork(2)</code> (i.e., <code>clone(2)</code>) isn&rsquo;t the right way to do so. The problem lies on the fact that <code>fork(2)</code> creates the new child by copying <strong>only</strong> the main thread of execution. Even if a Go program is single-threaded, under the hood there might be many other threads executing in the Go runtime. As a result, <code>fork(2)</code> isn&rsquo;t really a nice way of creating a child process in Go.</p>

<h2 id="possible-workarounds">Possible workarounds</h2>

<p>The first solution that comes to mind is to use the <code>os/exec</code> package. Plus, with this package it&rsquo;s possible to define the Namespaces of the child process by setting the attributes of the command:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#a6e22e">c</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">exec</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Command</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ls&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;-l&#34;</span>)
<span style="color:#a6e22e">c</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">SysProcAttr</span> = <span style="color:#a6e22e">syscall</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">SysProcAttr</span>{
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">Cloneflats</span>: <span style="color:#a6e22e">syscall</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">CLONE_NEWIPC</span>,
}
<span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">err</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">c</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Run</span>(); <span style="color:#a6e22e">err</span> <span style="color:#f92672">!=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">nil</span> {
    (<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>)</code></pre></div>

<p>Everything looks great, but if a process call itself, wouldn&rsquo;t the resulting process call itself again? Wouldn&rsquo;t I get into an infinite loop?</p>

<p>When I came accross this problem I promply split my program into two: a parent and a child. The former would simply call the latter with the appropriate flags set.  However, for practical reasons, I wanted to have all my code in a single program, so I started looking for alternatives.</p>

<p>Another possible solution would have been to have different arguments in the command to alternate between parent and child. For example, when executed, <code>program</code> would start in parent mode and then it would call itself by doing <code>program child</code>. That sounded a bit sloppy for me, though. For exampmle, what if the user call <code>program child</code> directly?</p>

<h2 id="my-choice">My choice</h2>

<p>I wondered how <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby">Moby</a> addresses this issue, so looking at its codebase I found the <code>reexec</code> package that does exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>The solution used by this package is very interesting. First, to call itself a process could simply execute <code>/proc/self/exe</code>, which, according to <code>proc(5)</code>, is a symbolic link to the actual executed command. Then, we could ovewrite the command&rsquo;s argument <code>os.Args[0]</code> in order to signal the resulting process that it&rsquo;s a child.</p>

<p>With that in mind, it&rsquo;s possible to re-execute a Go program by doing:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#a6e22e">c</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">exec</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Cmd</span>{
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">Path</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/proc/self/exe&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">Args</span>: []<span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span>{<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;child&#34;</span>},
    (<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>)
}
<span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">err</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">c</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Run</span>(); <span style="color:#a6e22e">err</span> <span style="color:#f92672">!=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">nil</span> {
    (<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>)
}</code></pre></div>

<p>And in <code>main()</code> we can check if the program running was re-executed by doing someting like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span>() {
	<span style="color:#66d9ef">switch</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">os</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Args</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>] {
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;parent&#34;</span>:
        (<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>)
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;child&#34;</span>:
        (<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>)
     }</code></pre></div>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right! We overwrote <code>os.Args[0]</code>!</p>

<p>This still smells like a hack, but I found it to be a nice way to re-execute a process in Go.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Dec 24, 2017</span>
        

<h1 id="on-reading">On reading</h1>

<p>I managed to complete my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/5493-2017-reading-challenge">2017 Reading Challenge</a> and read 12 books this year. This was an improvement from last year, when I read only 5.</p>

<p>To be quite frankly, I strategically picked a few small books so I could finish the challenge on time. I believe this is OK, but I would rather measure my reading habit by days I actually read something. Since it would be more difficult to track this approach, I am OK with the number of books for now.</p>

<p>Also, 2017 was the year that I got interested in fiction books. Non-fiction books are great to get new insights, but there is nothing more enjoyable that reading a good story in the early morning over a cup of coffee.</p>

<h1 id="on-writing-software">On writing software</h1>

<p>On the software engineeting side, I broke some new grounds in 2017.</p>

<p>I learned a little bit of Rust in the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>I read the first edition of The Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition">Programming Language</a> book and after a few days I manged to overcome the borrow checker and compile some small programs. Following that, I implemented a simple Pomodor timer that I called <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/prod">prod</a>. The highlight of the journey, though, was my implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/coreutils/commit/0a06679980e8b03d734a3ee5e3f5c2a785b081b6">uniq</a> command for the Redox OS.</p>

<p>I also got a bit more experience in Go. I developed a prototype for an NTP server called <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/ohrad">ohrad</a>. Also, I implemented a simple HTTTP daemon in my job. The highlight was <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah/pull/336">buildah PR</a>. This one was very rewarding for me, specially because buildah is part of the <a href="https://www.projectatomic.io/">Atomic Project</a>.</p>

<p>The ugly duckling was C. In the hope to get more experience in this language I started a simple in-memory cache that I called <a href="https://github.com/bertinatto/hashd">hashd</a>. I never really finished it, but I did learned a few new things on the way.</p>

<h1 id="on-changing-jobs">On changing jobs</h1>

<p>2017 was the year that I left Scrapinghub and joined Red Hat.</p>

<p>I left Scrapinghub after 3 years I can&rsquo;t even describe how much I evolved there. I was very happy to be joining Red Hat, but at the same time I was very sad to leave Scrapinghub.</p>

<p>The process of getting my Czech Visa approved took around 6 months, but fortunatelly everything worked out well.</p>

<h1 id="on-writing">On writing</h1>

<p>In 2017 I wrote many journal entries, but I failed to make it a habit. I found it a tedius task, but I confedd it&rsquo;s pretty rewarding to read something I wrote a long time ago. It&rsquo;s impressive to see how much I evolved and, at the same time, how I struggle with some recurring issues.</p>

<p>When it comes to blogging, I completely failed in 2017. I put down some random notes from different topics that later would become blog posts, but they never really reached to their  final destination.</p>

<h1 id="on-playing-the-guitar">On playing the guitar</h1>

<p>I started to play the guitar but I had to leave it in Brazil. I made some progress and managed to play a few simple musics and fingerstyles. Nothing that someone would enjoy listening to, though.</p>

<h1 id="on-lifting">On lifting</h1>

<p>I was deadlifting 140 kilos and squatting 136 kilos (not counting the bar) right before moving to Czech Republic. I had to stop lifting for a while until I settled down in Czech Republic, and my weights went down considerably. Hopefully I will get back to those numbers in 2018!</p>

<h1 id="on-traveling">On traveling</h1>

<p>The only long travel of 2017 happened when I moved from Brazil to Czech Republic. However, living in the middle of Europe brings great advantages! In 2017 I managed to visit 4 countries for the first time: Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Hungary.</p>
